1) minConf by Mark Schmidt

Used as an L-BFGS optimization blackbox for solving convex slave problems.
Our convex slave problems are not smooth, but L-BFGS seems to work well
with the subgradients of our objective. Box contraints are used to prevent
quadratic deformation parameters from becomes too small (or negative).
